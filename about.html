      How it works Hereâ€™s what you need to know before getting started with the
      navbar: Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with
      .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl|-xxl} for responsive collapsing and color
      scheme classes. Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Change
      the container to limit their horizontal width in different ways. Use our
      spacing and flex utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment
      within navbars. Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily
      modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse
      JavaScript plugin. Ensure accessibility by using a element or, if using a
      more generic element such as a , add a role="navigation" to every navbar
      to explicitly identify it as a landmark region for users of assistive
      technologies. Indicate the current item by using aria-current="page" for
      the current page or aria-current="true" for the current item in a set. New
      in v5.2.0: Navbars can be themed with CSS variables that are scoped to the
      .navbar base class. .navbar-light has been deprecated and .navbar-dark has
      been rewritten to override CSS variables instead of adding additional
      styles. The animation effect of this component is dependent on the
      prefers-reduced-motion media query. See the reduced motion section of our
      accessibility documentation
